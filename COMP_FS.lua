--Add some sort of redundancy check
    -- Currently, any RTL will cause GCS termination to occur after delay. Also termination will occur on the ground, but this could actually be good for testing
--AFS must be enabled for termination to occur, but this specifically uses standard GCS Failsafes. Should I change to REMRSSI and Heartbeat?

--Ideas
    --Use RTL in conjunction with FLTMODE_CH not being RTL
    --Use RTL in conjunction with RC Loss (Throttle failsafe), but this is no different from regular RC failsafe unless i disable rc failsafe and only do them together in this script but thats a bit sketchy
